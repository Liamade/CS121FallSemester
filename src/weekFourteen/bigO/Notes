What is Big 0?
    -describes the performance or complexity of an algorithm
    -Time Complexity
        -worst case scenario (max amount of space an algorithm will take)
        -the time it takes to run a function
            -based on size of the input data

    -Space Complexity
        -the space an algorithm requires
    -COMPLEXITY CHART
        -0(log n) - Logarithmic time
            -time is going to grow logarithmically with input size
            -as data grows its going to level off
        -O(1) - constant time
            -doesn't change based off increasing input
